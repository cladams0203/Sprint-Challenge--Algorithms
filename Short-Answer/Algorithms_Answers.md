#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -- The number of operations is proportional to the size of the input


b)O(n log n) -- Operations grows faster than O(n) but not at a O(n^2) rate


c)O(n)  -- The number of operations is Proportional to the size of the input --recursive

## Exercise II
  A Binary Search Tree would be best for this situation to minimize the loss of eggs. 
Basically start at the middle of nth floors and drop the egg.  If the egg breaks move to the
lower half of the floors and run the same operation else move to the upper floors and do the same.
